# The Movie Data Base

## Installation
Please run `pod install` and then run the project

## What is this?
* This is a smaple project i created for showing async image pulling on iOS.
* I chose not to use any 3rd party (Kingfisher, SDWebImage etc....)
* Instead i tried to achieve a cache system and async image loading , but surely those packages will work better
* The app pulls the top movies based on the phone country
* Movies can be added to different watchlists
* You can add or remove watchlists
* Search movies based on name only at the moment.

## Feedback
* Any feedback will be welcome, always looking for a ways to improve.
